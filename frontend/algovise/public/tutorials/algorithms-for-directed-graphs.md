# Algorithms for Directed Graphs

Directed graphs (also known as digraphs) are graphs where the edges have a direction, meaning each edge connects one vertex to another in a specific direction. Many fundamental graph algorithms can be applied to directed graphs, often with some adaptations to account for the directionality of the edges.

In this section, we will explore various algorithms specifically designed for or applicable to directed graphs.

## 1. Topological Sort

### Overview
Topological sorting is a linear ordering of the vertices in a directed graph such that for every directed edge `(u, v)`, vertex `u` comes before vertex `v` in the ordering. This algorithm is only applicable to Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

### Steps
1. Compute the in-degree of each vertex (the number of incoming edges).
2. Add all vertices with in-degree 0 to a queue.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   - Remove a vertex from the queue.
   - Add it to the topological order.
   - Decrease the in-degree of its neighbors.
   - If any neighbor has an in-degree of 0, add it to the queue.

### Use Cases
- Task scheduling (e.g., project management).
- Compiler optimization.
- Determining the order of course prerequisites.

## 2. Strongly Connected Components (SCC) Detection

### Overview
A Strongly Connected Component (SCC) is a subgraph of a directed graph in which every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. Kosaraju’s algorithm and Tarjan’s algorithm are two famous algorithms for finding SCCs.

### Kosaraju’s Algorithm
1. Perform DFS on the graph and store the vertices in a stack in the order of finishing time.
2. Reverse the graph (reverse the direction of all edges).
3. Perform DFS on the reversed graph in the order of the vertices in the stack.
4. Each DFS call identifies a strongly connected component.

### Tarjan’s Algorithm
1. Use DFS to traverse the graph and assign each vertex a low-link value.
2. A vertex is part of an SCC if it is the root of an SCC (the low-link value is equal to the vertex's index).
3. If a back edge leads to a previously visited vertex, update the low-link value.

### Use Cases
- Finding strongly connected subgraphs in web link analysis.
- Cycle detection in directed graphs.
- Social network analysis (e.g., identifying communities).

## 3. Shortest Path in Directed Graphs

### Overview
For directed graphs with weighted edges, the shortest path problem involves finding the shortest path from a source vertex to a destination vertex. The two most common algorithms for this are Dijkstra’s algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm.

### Dijkstra’s Algorithm
1. Initialize the distance to the source vertex as 0 and all other vertices as infinity.
2. Use a priority queue to always choose the vertex with the smallest tentative distance.
3. For each adjacent vertex, if the path through the current vertex is shorter than the previously known path, update the distance.

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm
1. Initialize the distance to the source vertex as 0 and all other vertices as infinity.
2. For each edge `(u, v)` in the graph, if the distance to `u` is not infinity and the path through `u` offers a shorter path to `v`, update the distance to `v`.
3. Repeat this process for all vertices for `V-1` iterations (where `V` is the number of vertices).

### Use Cases
- Finding the shortest path in routing algorithms (e.g., IP routing).
- Navigation systems in maps.
- Financial networks for determining the shortest time to reach an asset or company.

## 4. Cycle Detection in Directed Graphs

### Overview
Cycle detection in directed graphs is a fundamental problem in graph theory. Detecting cycles is important for detecting infinite loops, deadlocks, or recursive dependencies.

### Algorithm: DFS Cycle Detection
1. Perform a DFS traversal of the graph.
2. Mark vertices as:
   - **Unvisited**: Not yet visited.
   - **Visiting**: Currently being explored (in the DFS recursion stack).
   - **Visited**: Fully explored (all descendants have been visited).
3. If a vertex is marked as "Visiting" during the DFS, a cycle has been detected.

### Use Cases
- Deadlock detection in concurrent systems.
- Verifying dependencies in build systems.
- Detecting infinite loops in recursive algorithms.

## 5. Maximum Flow in Directed Graphs

### Overview
The Maximum Flow problem is to determine the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from a source vertex to a sink vertex in a directed graph, where edges have capacity constraints.

### Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
1. Find an augmenting path (a path from source to sink where additional flow can be pushed through the edges).
2. Increase the flow along the augmenting path.
3. Repeat the process until no augmenting path can be found.

### Edmonds-Karp Algorithm
1. It is an implementation of Ford-Fulkerson using breadth-first search (BFS) to find augmenting paths.
2. Each BFS call finds the shortest augmenting path, improving the efficiency of the algorithm.

### Use Cases
- Network traffic management.
- Bipartite matching problems.
- Resource allocation and transportation networks.

## 6. Acyclicity Check in Directed Graphs

### Overview
A directed graph is acyclic if it does not contain any cycles. An acyclic directed graph is called a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Checking if a graph is a DAG is important in various applications such as scheduling, dependency resolution, and topological sorting.

### Algorithm: DFS Acyclicity Check
1. Perform DFS traversal of the graph.
2. If during the traversal a vertex is encountered that is already in the recursion stack (i.e., it’s marked as "Visiting"), then a cycle is detected, and the graph is not acyclic.

### Use Cases
- Task scheduling and job dependencies.
- Data flow analysis.
- Resolving circular dependencies in software package managers.

## 7. Graph Traversal in Directed Graphs

### Overview
Graph traversal algorithms like DFS and BFS can be applied to directed graphs. The key difference in directed graphs is that traversal only follows the direction of the edges, which can impact the way vertices are visited.

### DFS in Directed Graphs
1. Begin traversal from a source vertex.
2. Mark vertices as visited and recursively visit their neighbors.
3. Since the edges are directed, the traversal can only proceed in the direction of the edges.

### BFS in Directed Graphs
1. Start from the source vertex and explore all reachable vertices level by level.
2. Queue the vertices to be explored and process them in the order they are dequeued.
3. Only directed edges are followed during exploration.

### Use Cases
- Analyzing directed networks such as web links.
- Social network analysis where the direction of relationships matters.
- Search engines for crawling directed hyperlinks.
