# Classic Graph Problems

Classic graph problems are fundamental to graph theory and have a wide range of applications in computer science, optimization, and network analysis. These problems often serve as the basis for more advanced algorithms and techniques. In this section, we will discuss several classic graph problems and their solutions.

## 1. Depth-First Search (DFS)

### Overview
Depth-First Search (DFS) is a traversal algorithm for visiting all vertices in a graph. Starting from a source vertex, DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### Steps
1. Start at a vertex and mark it as visited.
2. Explore each adjacent vertex that has not been visited.
3. Recursively visit unvisited neighbors.
4. Backtrack when no more unvisited neighbors are found.

### Example
For a graph with vertices `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`, starting at `A`, DFS will visit all connected vertices and backtrack when necessary.

### Use Cases
- Pathfinding in mazes.
- Detecting cycles in a graph.
- Solving puzzles or games like Sudoku or mazes.

## 2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

### Overview
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is another graph traversal algorithm that explores all vertices at the present depth level before moving on to vertices at the next depth level. It is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

### Steps
1. Start at a vertex and enqueue it.
2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a vertex and visit all its unvisited neighbors.
3. Enqueue unvisited neighbors and continue until all vertices are visited.

### Example
Given a graph with vertices `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`, starting from vertex `A`, BFS will explore each level before moving deeper into the graph.

### Use Cases
- Finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
- Solving problems like the "6 degrees of separation".
- Web crawlers.

## 3. Dijkstra's Algorithm

### Overview
Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem in a graph with non-negative edge weights. It is widely used in network routing.

### Steps
1. Initialize the distance to the source vertex as 0 and all other vertices as infinity.
2. Set the source vertex as the current vertex and mark it as visited.
3. For each unvisited neighbor of the current vertex, update its distance if a shorter path is found.
4. Choose the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance and set it as the current vertex.
5. Repeat until all vertices are visited.

### Example
In a weighted graph with vertices `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`, Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from the source to all other vertices.

### Use Cases
- Shortest path in network routing (e.g., IP routing in the internet).
- Navigation systems.
- Flight and transportation scheduling.

## 4. Topological Sort

### Overview
Topological Sort is used to order vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge `(u, v)`, vertex `u` comes before `v` in the ordering.

### Steps
1. Compute the in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each vertex.
2. Enqueue vertices with zero in-degree.
3. Process each vertex by removing it from the queue and decreasing the in-degree of its neighbors.
4. If the in-degree of a neighbor becomes zero, enqueue it.

### Example
For a directed graph with vertices `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`, topological sort can be used to order tasks in a workflow, ensuring that prerequisites are completed before dependent tasks.

### Use Cases
- Task scheduling and project management.
- Course prerequisite ordering.
- Compiler optimization and job scheduling.

## 5. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

### Overview
A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted graph is a subset of the edges that connects all vertices together without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. Two popular algorithms for finding MSTs are Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms.

### Kruskal’s Algorithm
1. Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
2. Add edges to the MST in the sorted order, ensuring no cycles are formed.

### Prim’s Algorithm
1. Start with a vertex and add the smallest edge connecting a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST.
2. Repeat until all vertices are included in the MST.

### Example
Given a graph with vertices `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` and weighted edges, both Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms can find the minimum spanning tree.

### Use Cases
- Network design (e.g., connecting cities with the least cost).
- Cluster analysis in machine learning.
- Power grid optimization.

## 6. Strongly Connected Components (SCC)

### Overview
A strongly connected component (SCC) is a maximal subgraph in which there is a directed path between every pair of vertices. Tarjan’s algorithm or Kosaraju’s algorithm can be used to find SCCs in a directed graph.

### Steps (Kosaraju’s Algorithm)
1. Perform a DFS on the original graph and store the vertices in a stack in the order of finishing time.
2. Reverse the directions of all edges in the graph.
3. Perform DFS on the reversed graph in the order of the stack to find SCCs.

### Example
For a directed graph, Kosaraju’s algorithm will identify the strongly connected components, grouping vertices that are mutually reachable.

### Use Cases
- Finding strongly connected components in web page link analysis.
- Detecting cycles in directed graphs.
- Analyzing social networks.

## 7. Maximum Flow Problem

### Overview
The Maximum Flow Problem involves finding the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from a source vertex to a sink vertex in a flow network, subject to capacity constraints. The Edmonds-Karp algorithm (an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method) is commonly used to solve this problem.

### Steps
1. Initialize the flow in the network to 0.
2. Use BFS or DFS to find an augmenting path from the source to the sink.
3. Augment the flow along this path and repeat until no more augmenting paths can be found.

### Example
In a flow network with source `S` and sink `T`, the algorithm finds the maximum flow that can be sent through the network from `S` to `T`.

### Use Cases
- Network flow optimization (e.g., internet traffic management).
- Bipartite matching and resource allocation problems.
- Transportation and logistics.
