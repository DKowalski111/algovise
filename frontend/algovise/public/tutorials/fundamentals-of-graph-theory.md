# Fundamentals of Graph Theory

## 1. Introduction
Graph Theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties and applications of graphs. A graph is a collection of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between nodes). It is used in various fields such as computer science, biology, and social networks.

## 2. Types of Graphs
### Directed Graphs (Digraphs)
A directed graph has edges with a direction, meaning each edge goes from one vertex to another in a specific direction.

### Undirected Graphs
An undirected graph has edges that do not have a direction. Each edge simply connects two vertices.

### Weighted Graphs
A weighted graph has edges assigned with weights, which can represent costs, distances, or other measures.

## 3. Graph Representations
Graphs can be represented in multiple ways:
- **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array where each cell `(i, j)` indicates the presence of an edge between vertex `i` and vertex `j`.
- **Adjacency List**: A list where each vertex points to a list of connected vertices.
- **Edge List**: A list of all edges represented as vertex pairs.

## 4. Applications of Graph Theory
Graph theory is used in:
- **Routing Algorithms**: Internet data routing, GPS navigation.
- **Social Networks**: Representing relationships and interactions.
- **Biological Systems**: Protein interactions, gene expression networks.
- **Project Management**: Dependency graphs for tasks.

## 5. Algorithms in Graph Theory
### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
A graph traversal algorithm that explores all vertices at the present depth level before moving to the next.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
A traversal algorithm that explores as far along a branch as possible before backtracking.
